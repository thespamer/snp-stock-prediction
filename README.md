S&P 500 Stock Prediction with Prophet
Overview

This project uses the Prophet library to predict stock prices for up to 10 S&P 500 stocks based on historical data. By leveraging publicly available datasets, the project demonstrates how to preprocess data, train a time-series forecasting model, and visualize predictions for a 2-year horizon. The approach is designed to provide actionable insights for business strategy and market analysis.
Features

    Predictive Model: Forecasts stock prices for individual symbols (e.g., AAPL, GOOG) using the Prophet library.
    Customizable Analysis: Easily switch target stocks by editing the list of symbols.
    Visualization: Generates and saves forecast plots and components (e.g., trends, seasonalities).
    Scalable: Focuses on a subset of stocks to minimize runtime while maintaining flexibility for larger datasets.

Dependencies

Before running the project, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

    Python 3.8 or newer
    Libraries:
        pandas
        numpy
        matplotlib
        prophet (or fbprophet for older environments)

Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following commands:

# Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel to avoid installation issues
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

# Install the required libraries
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib prophet

    Note: If you encounter issues with Prophet, ensure that cmdstanpy is installed:

    pip install cmdstanpy

Project Structure

sp500_prophet/
├── sp500_stocks/            # Folder for dataset
│   └── sp500_stocks.csv     # Historical stock data (input file)
├── tutorial_sp500_prophet.py # Main script for data analysis and prediction
└── README.md                # Project documentation

Dataset

The dataset sp500_stocks.csv should contain historical stock data, including columns like:

    Date (date of the record)
    Symbol (stock ticker, e.g., AAPL, MSFT)
    Open, High, Low, Close, Volume (daily trading data)

Download and place the dataset in the sp500_stocks folder.
How to Run

    Prepare the Dataset:
        Download the dataset sp500_stocks.csv and place it in the sp500_stocks folder.

    Customize the Target Symbols:
        Open tutorial_sp500_prophet.py.
        Edit the TARGET_SYMBOLS list to specify up to 10 stock symbols you want to analyze. Example:

    TARGET_SYMBOLS = ["AAPL", "MSFT", "AMZN", "GOOG", "TSLA"]

Run the Script:

    In the terminal, navigate to the project folder and execute:

        python tutorial_sp500_prophet.py

    View the Results:
        For each stock symbol, the script generates:
            <SYMBOL>_forecast.png: Forecast of stock prices for the next 2 years.
            <SYMBOL>_forecast_components.png: Detailed breakdown of trends, seasonality, and residuals.

Example Output

    Forecast Plot (AAPL_forecast.png): Displays historical stock prices and 2-year predictions.
    Components Plot (AAPL_forecast_components.png): Shows trend and seasonal patterns influencing the forecast.

Notes

    Runtime: Processing time depends on the number of symbols and the length of the historical data. For 10 symbols, it typically takes a few minutes.
    Prophet Library: Prophet is optimized for time-series forecasting but may not fully account for financial market volatility or unexpected events.

Troubleshooting

    Prophet Installation Issues:
        Ensure cmdstanpy is installed:

pip install cmdstanpy

For older environments, use fbprophet:

    pip install fbprophet

NumPy Compatibility:

    If using PyTorch or encountering NumPy issues, downgrade to NumPy 1.x:

        pip install numpy<2.0

    Dataset Issues:
        Ensure the dataset includes valid stock symbols and complete historical data. Use pandas to inspect and clean the data if necessary.

Conclusion

This project highlights the potential of using public datasets and advanced time-series forecasting tools like Prophet to generate meaningful predictions. It can be extended with additional data (e.g., economic indicators or social sentiment) to improve accuracy and applicability. Feel free to explore, adapt, and enhance the pipeline to suit your needs.
